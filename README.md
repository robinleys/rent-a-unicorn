# Rent a Unicorn

For years, the world deprived us from enjoying the presence of unicorns, pegasi and alicorns.
That all changed one day, when classmates Abdullah, Eefje, Ranayana and Robin encountered a magical portal behind BeCode's campus building leading to a land where these majestic creatures live.
United in their mission of sharing a little bit of this magic with the rest of th e world, they founded Rent a Unicorn, a service that allows people to connect with unicorns, alicorns and pegasi while also keeping them safe.
